Proposed API for HTML5 parser in Javascript

var HTML5 = require('html5')

HTML5.parse(string, [{DOM: domModule}]) -> DOM objects

new HTML5.Parser(source, [{DOM: domModule}]) -> eventEmitter with "document"
property. emits "end" when fully parsed, and the document property is a DOM
tree


Internal:

new HTML5.Tokenizer(source) -> eventEmitter that emits 'token' for each token
and 'end' when done. This isn't useful outside the parser since the tokenizer
needs feedback from the parser.

The Tokenizer has a "state" property that is the name of the function to call
for the current tokenizer state.
