* oops, fix test
* drop leading newline for <textarea> too
* get optionaltags tests working again
* Fixed tests re. attribute value quoting in serialization (attribute values use the "best" quote character depending on the attribute value, defaulting to " when it contains both " and ')
* Test: start-tags with attributes are never optional (test uses <html lang=en>)
* Serializer tests for optional tags no longer contain the serialization with optional tags *not* omitted. This is now tested within the tests python code (which makes it easier to disable such a test to ensure optional tags *are* omitted)

* Fixes in HTMLSerializer and additional serializer tests.

* simplify test_parser() in test_parser.py; now the new lines are no longer needed
* fix parse.py to work with multiline input; do the same for test_parser.py; remove the #data at the end of the two test files, test files require two new lines at the end for now; add a testcase which has a new line; make some editorial changes in parser.py
