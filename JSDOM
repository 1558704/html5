DOM.Node has no properties like TEXT_NODE, so comparing aNode.nodeType to Node.TEXT_NODE won't work as it does in the browser DOM

NamedNodeMap of attributes (at least) doesn't work when accessed with [n], only item(n)

Adding a DocumentType is different than in env-js at least.
	var dt = new DOM.DocumentType()
	dt.nodeName = 'html'
throws undefined

publicId and systemId are properties of dt.notations, not of dt, unlike the browser

DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE instead of DOCTYPE_NODE â€¦ This is just be env-js being dumb and allowing it
